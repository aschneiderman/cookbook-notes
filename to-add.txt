In one series but not another
res = ps1[~ps1.isin(ps2)]

try df.info()

# Index

index: looks like just another column, but it's not
it's a unique label for each of your rows
ex: to look up a row, use index

just like w arrays etc, by default it's 0,1,2, etc 
But can use any data -- eg date or students name 
multi index: where it's unique not by one column but several columns -- esp w hierarchical data

.dtypes

count: non missing values

chain w spacing:
(autos
[cols]
.astype( {'highway': 'int8', ...})
.select_dtypes(int,'int8')
.describe
)

.query

to reduce memory usage -- which means more room for data -- convert everything to types, including 'category'

.assign
drive=autos.drive.fillna('Other').astype('Category'),
automatic=auto.trany.str.contains('Auto')

or .str.extract(r'(\d)+').fillna('20').astype('int8')
.drop(columns=['bla'])

why chain: looks like a recipe
vs 50 lines of code, w a lot of intermediary variables (which eats up memory)
to debug it: can easily comment out lines



Don't use apply if you can
instead 
autos.make.astype(str).isin({'red', 'blue'})

or if make is a categorical:
autos.make.isin({'red', 'blue'})

category: stores int and maps it to string 

if:
.assign(country=np.select(cond,true,false)

%%timeit at start of cell: will time it

for loops: not always bad, just thing twice -- often don't need it, not using it is faster

Pivot table w the fixins:
( 
.groupby
.agg(['min','mean', my_function])


using .pipe?  


pandas often have several ways to do things 

np.where, np.select
